1. **Exception Handling**:

   - Using try-except blocks for handling exceptions.
   - Handling multiple exceptions and specifying exception types.
   - finally block and cleanup actions.
   - Raising exceptions using raise statement.
   - Custom exception classes.
   - Use cases: error handling, input validation, defensive programming.

2. **Functional Programming**:

   - Higher-order functions and functional purity.
   - Immutable data structures.
   - Map, filter, and reduce functions.
   - Recursion vs. iteration.
   - Use cases: data transformation, data processing pipelines, algorithmic problem-solving.

3. **Concurrency and Parallelism**:

   - Understanding concurrency vs. parallelism.
   - Threading and multiprocessing modules.
   - GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and its implications.
   - Asynchronous programming with async/await (asyncio module).
   - Use cases: concurrent I/O-bound tasks, parallel CPU-bound tasks, improving performance.

4. **Metaprogramming**:

   - Understanding metaclasses and class decorators.
   - Dynamically creating classes and objects.
   - Accessing and modifying attributes and methods at runtime.
   - Use cases: framework development, code generation, extending and customizing behavior.

5. **Context Managers**:
   - Using the `with` statement to manage resources.
   - Implementing context managers with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.
   - Using contextlib module for creating context managers.
   - Use cases: file handling, database connections, thread synchronization, resource cleanup.
