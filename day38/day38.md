## Tasks

1. Import the necessary libraries for handling audio files, numerical operations, and data visualization.
1. Define a function that takes a directory and a list of file paths as input, loads each audio file from the specified directory, and appends the loaded files to a list.
1. Define two functions that take a list of sound names and a list of raw sounds as input, and plot spectrograms of the sounds. The first function should plot the spectrogram in Hz scale and the second function should plot the spectrogram in note scale.
1. Create a list of sound file paths and a list of sound names, and define a parent directory.
1. Use the function from step 2 to load the sound files from the specified directory and file paths.
1. Use the functions from step 3 to display the spectrograms of the loaded sound files in Hz and note scales respectively.
1. Please ensure that your script is well-commented and adheres to best practices for Python code.
