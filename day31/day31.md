### Day 31

Personal Plans For Today

1. **Generators**:

   - Understanding generator functions and generator expressions.
   - Differences between generators and regular functions.
   - Lazy evaluation and memory efficiency.
   - Use cases: processing large datasets, creating infinite sequences, asynchronous programming.

2. **List Comprehensions**:

   - Syntax and usage of list comprehensions for concise and expressive code.
   - Nested list comprehensions.
   - Conditional expressions in list comprehensions.
   - Performance considerations compared to traditional loops.
   - Use cases: transforming data, filtering elements, creating lists with specific patterns.

3. **Decorators**:

   - Defining and using decorators to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods.
   - Decorating functions with other functions.
   - Decorating class methods.
   - Passing arguments to decorators.
   - Use cases: logging, authentication, caching, memoization, performance profiling.

4. **Lambda Functions**:

   - Understanding lambda expressions for creating anonymous functions.
   - Syntax and limitations of lambda functions.
   - Use cases: passing simple functions as arguments, functional programming, sorting.

5. **Iterators and Iterables**:
   - Understanding iterable objects and iterators.
   - Implementing iterators using `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
   - Using built-in iterators like `iter()` and `next()`.
   - Iterating over custom objects.
   - Use cases: custom data structures, lazy evaluation, creating your own iterable objects.
